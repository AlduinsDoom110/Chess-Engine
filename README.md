# Chess Engine
This project provides a minimal chess engine implemented in Python. It supports
basic move generation, a simple evaluation function and a minimax search with
alpha-beta pruning.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to play against the engine. Moves are entered in simple
coordinate notation, for example `e2e4`.

+```bash
+python3 main.py
+```
+
+## Modules
+
+- `board.py` implements the board representation and move generation.
+- `engine.py` contains evaluation and search functions.
+- `main.py` provides a very small command line interface.
+
+The code is intended as a starting point for further experiments and
+improvements.

This repository contains a small Python chess engine built on top of the
[`python-chess`](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/) library.  It supports all
conventional chess rules and uses a simple minimax search with alphaâ€‘beta
pruning as a demonstration engine.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* `python-chess` (`pip install chess`)

## Usage

Run the command line interface and play against the engine:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

Enter moves in coordinate notation such as `e2e4` or, for promotions,
`e7e8q`.

### Using the engine with UCI

The repository also includes a minimal [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface)
driver.  Run `uci.py` and connect to it from any UCI compatible GUI:

```bash
python3 uci.py
```

Only a subset of the protocol is supported (e.g. `position` and `go depth N`).
