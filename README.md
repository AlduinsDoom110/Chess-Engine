This project provides a minimal chess engine implemented in Python. It supports
basic move generation, a simple evaluation function and a minimax search with
alpha-beta pruning.

## Requirements

* Python 3.8+

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to play against the engine. Moves are entered in simple
coordinate notation, for example `e2e4`.

+```bash
+python3 main.py
+```
+
+## Modules
+
+- `board.py` implements the board representation and move generation.
+- `engine.py` contains evaluation and search functions.
+- `main.py` provides a very small command line interface.
+
+The code is intended as a starting point for further experiments and
+improvements.
